                    <h1>My site report</h1>
                    <div class="introduction">
                        <h1>My experience building this website</h1>
                        <p>I started the website design by drawing a mock design on paper and following the guidelines,
                            although it seemed like I already learned everything I needed from classes I pretty fast hit
                            a wall when it came to applying this knowledge to the website, I made a few mistakes in the
                            beginning, one was using the flex box to design almost half of the website, after carefully
                            reading the brief again I noticed my mistake and went back to correct it, the second mistake
                            was when I made the blog page I read in between the lines of the brief so when the blog page
                            was ready I realised I needed a different design and approach.</p>
                        <p> I corrected this fast as I refurbished the already made code to be my portfolio page as the
                            code fitted perfectly there, for the blog page I had fun creating the design to look like a
                            standard WordPress blog page, with "fake" links to imitate the real use of a link in some
                            parts of the text but this was not possible on my machine so I just left the design as it
                            is. On the portfolio page I made a clean presentation of some of my active projects with
                            links integrated into them so you can visit and interact with the websites, unfortunately a
                            lot of my past projects were closed by their owners so I couldn't add a link but I still had
                            some screenshots so I refurbished them into a website mock design. </p>

                        <p> I created the contact page where I added a banner reminding the person visiting who I am and
                            what I am doing, along with that I added my social media links along with images and mock
                            icons for personal contact (WhatsApp, email, and phone), alongside that sits a contact form
                            banner with the contact form and an image reassuring people that a real person is behind the
                            website.
                            Finally, I added the site report were I am writing this text, the page will display my
                            original website mock design, my page validations that are to my astonishment on a healthy
                            percentage at first and only a few changes were needed to get a pass validation.
                            My view on this project is that although I worked for a few years with page builders to
                            build websites being afraid to learn how to code because it seemed at that time an
                            impossible thing for me to perceive, moving from Romania to follow my passion and starting
                            the university I can see a huge amount of experience and skills I have built in only 1 year,
                            I cannot wait to see the future projects that I will have as I can sincerely say I enjoy
                            studying here and practicing everything not only theories make me really love gaining more
                            skills. </p>

                        <p>I have choosen a color that resonates with me for this portofolio, in this case it was purple
                            with different variations of it to create the gradients while keeping the design simple.
                            I had different fonts to choose from, but the one i have left in the end was "'Segoe UI',
                            Tahoma, Geneva, Verdana, sans-serif;" as it looks good and it is easy to read by the visual
                            impaired persons.

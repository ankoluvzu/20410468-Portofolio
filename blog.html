                            <p>The first step I made with this website was to hand design the website mock, after that it was pretty easy to follow the mock and code the design.... Pretty easy right? </p>
                            <p>Well as everything that seems pretty easy, transcribing this to real life I got a big slap regarding my so tought "good coding skills".</p>
                            <p>At the start I made some huge mistakes because I read in between the brief lines, spent a lot of time designing and coding using flexbox (managed to do the header, footer, index and blog). </p> 
                            <p>Luckily enough I read te brif again, and I noticed that we need to use the grid layout and changed all of them to grid layout wich if I may add i absolutely love as it's more easy to code with it. </p>
                            <p>Overall the most time-consuming and important part of the index page was the header and the footer as they repeat on every page and if I ruin the code there I could break the website design everywhere. </p>
                            <p>I found that making the branches for every part I want to code on the website made my life easier as I didn't have to stress over ruining a part of the code that was already good</p>

                            <h1>Blog page and all it's beauty!</h1>
                            <h5>Published on: 09/04/2022 by Madalina</h5>
                            <p>After discovering that the grid layout is much faster, I created a simple blog page following the simple standard WordPress short blog description. </p>
                            <p>After that I added some of my designed websites to post them as a blog post, after I finished it I didn't like how it looked as a blog.</p>
                            <p>At that point i made the decision that the initial blog code will fit better as a portofolio and copied the code in the portofolio.html and portofolio.css file. </p> 
                            <p>Seeing the good side of it "At least I have my portofolio code" I started to change the blog code to resemble more of a blog post. </p>
                            <p>I added a "fake published date and author" then added a read more button to give the impression of a real blog, even though the link code is in the page, I didn't have a link to link it, so I just left it as it is.</p>
                            <p>At the end of my blog designing and coding journey I made custom changes in CSS to add the purple color I have on the website to create an elegant visual effect</p>

                            <h1>Designing the portofolio</h1>
                            <h5>Published on: 11/04/2022 by Madalina</h5>
                            <p>Because i transfered the initial blog code onto the portofolio page, I made a rookie mistake and didn't change the link from the blog.css to portofolio.css</p>
                            <p>This resulted in a few hours of running around and checking all over the internet why my changes didn't work on the website, after finally noticing that I forgot to change the link everything went on pretty smooth.</p>
                            <p>To resemble as a normal portofolio page, I left the design to be simple and pretty stright forward, I added some of my actual projects that I'm working on, linking them with the website url, so everyone can check them. </p> 
                            <p>Unfortunately a lot of my past projects were closed by the owners and didn't have a workign link for them, but I still had screenshots of the website, so I converted them into a website mock image and displayed them on the page. </p>
                            <p>Overall I believe I added a few of them there I am personally happy with the way the page looks. </p>
                            <p>At the end I added CSS effects for the websites with the active link to shake and the ones witouth a link just to float to give the visual distinction of the link that it's working and the one that is not.</p>

                            <h5>Published on: 13/04/2022 by Madalina</h5>
                            <p>At first I created a banner introducing me again, trying to create that "trust" between me and the viewer, added a small introduction as well just to be sure that it gets a good intention.</p>
                            <p>The second thing I was interested at was finding a way to fit 6 icons in a row to create an estetic view and being straight forward as how they can reach me.</p> 
                            <p>After that the hardest process begins, I wanted to create a contact form but to be a banner with a picture incorporated. As usual pretty easy right? </p>
                            <p>Well I tried multiple ways to incorporate the form and a picture in the same row witouth creating a class for it, unfortunately I didn't manage to do this, so I created a class, and after it was pretty straight forward sizing them and orienting on the page, to add a little charm to it, I even added a background colour to spice the color palette.</p>

                            <p>Started writing my experience with the whole process of building a website from scratch. </p>
                            <p>After that i scanned and added all the initial designs so you can make an ideea what was planed and what was achieved.</p>
                            <p>Added the dsign scheme i had that included a list of fonts intended to use, at the end i used only one font and the color scheme for the website. </p> 
                            <p>I was scared at first to run the validation tests as i was thinking that my code is not good enough and i will fail, i can say i am pretty happy ionly had some minor things to change to acheve a full validation. </p>

                            <h5>Published on: 17/04/2022 by Madalina</h5>
                            <p>Even tough in the beginig it felt I was going nowhere with the code and design, making plenty of mistakes and even crashing the website when I first merged the codes togheder. </p>
                            <p>This project really made me understand and create a logic of how things work in HTML and CSS, and working on it and keeping on making mistakes taught me that even though you know things theoretically, practice is the best way to learn how to do things.</p>
                            <p>In the early stages of building the website it felt like adding and removing things becomes more easy, even though I always have the constant fear that maybe I didn't do something properly, or maybe I forgot to add somethign in the back end. </p> 
                            <p>As I was building websites for years using page builders because coding felt difficult to learn I can say that after this project I am more keen to design my own websites and not be constrainted by the plugins settings, ineffiiency. </p>

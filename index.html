                        <h1>My journey</h1>
                        <p>Hello, my name is Madalina, and I am originally from Romania, growing up I was always
                            passionate about computers, I remember when I first got my brand-new desktop the next day I
                            opened and disassembled everything just to see how it works, after the next week I took my
                            Windows XP down and took me 7 tries to learn how to install it...you can guess how happy my
                            parents were... </p>
                        <p>Growing up I developed plenty of passions and skills around the wonderful world of web
                            leading to my actual passion, web design. When I discovered Shopify and building stores
                            online, I was instantly hooked up into building stores and later developed into this
                            excitement of building anything in WordPress and Shopify mainly because I was limited to
                            page builders and learning how to code seemed impossible for me to learn</p>
                        <p>This is until I took my heart into my hands and decided to go to university, so I can learn
                            more about web development, unfortunately in Romania at that time there were no universities
                            that were teaching computing, web development especially, so I took the next step, I applied
                            to university in UK leaving faith to decide if this was the next step to take. </p>
                        <p>As you can guess I got into university in Northampton, so I took my belongings and left
                            everything I had back home, so I can come here and study my passion. </p>

                        <h1>My year so far...</h1>
                        <p>I started university last year with the Foundation year, initially I was disappointed by the
                            idea to take an extra year to finish, but during the course of the last year I was impressed
                            on the "Learning how to learn" courses, they taught me valuable information about what you
                            need to do correctly to finish university. </p>
                        <p>At the beginning of this year I was scared by the amount of skills I have to learn in a
                            relatively so little time, but this showed me that if you try and stay consistent with
                            learning... Well it's not so hard to learn a new skill even though it will take a lot of
                            time
                            to become good at it, this is only my first year.</p>
                        <p>The courses were a little hard for me as English is not my native language and some concepts
                            were hard to understand especially the technical words, but in time I got used to it and I
                            can say that the university life taught me more English that I can imagine. </p>
